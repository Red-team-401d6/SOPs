# Rules of engagement

## Purpose:
The purpose of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for planning a Red Teaming exercise, including establishing Rules of Engagement (RoE), is to conduct a comprehensive, 
controlled, and ethical simulated attack on an organization's security infrastructure.

## Scope:
This SOP applies to all members of the organization who are responsible for writing and maintaining SOPs.

## Responsibilities:
All members of the organization are responsible for following this SOP when creating new SOPs.

## Objective Setting:
Define the objective for the red team exercise. The goal should be to test the effectiveness of existing security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities. Make sure that the scope and objectives are approved by the organization's senior leadership.

## Team Selection:
Assemble a red team that includes a diverse set of skills. This team might consist of both internal and external resources, such as in-house security professionals and contracted ethical hackers.

## Planning Phase:
Plan the red team exercise carefully. This includes determining the length of the operation, selecting specific systems or processes to test, and creating hypothetical attack scenarios that the red team will use during the exercise.

## Establishing Rules of Engagement (RoE):
These rules define the limits within which the red team should operate to prevent unnecessary damage and legal complications. The RoE should cover the following aspects:

## Scope: 
Clearly define what systems, networks, or physical locations are within the scope of the operation. Ensure there is explicit agreement on the targets of the engagement.

## Methods and Techniques: 
Identify what types of attacks are permitted (e.g., phishing, DDoS, physical intrusion, etc.) and which are not. Define the depth of the engagement like if any social engineering or active exploits will be used or not.

## Timing: 
Specify when the attacks may take place. This could be during work hours, after hours, or even a mix.

## Escalation Procedures: 
If the red team encounters a previously unknown critical vulnerability, an escalation process should be in place.

## Communication: The lines of communication between the red team, blue team (internal security team), and the management should be established.
Legal and Compliance Requirements: Ensure all activities comply with local laws and regulations. Also, understand and define the actions in case of breach of RoE.

## Pre-Engagement:
Inform all relevant stakeholders about the upcoming red team exercise, especially those who need to know such as the Incident Response team. Be careful to maintain the necessary level of secrecy to ensure the exercise's effectiveness.

## Execution:
Carry out the red teaming exercise according to the plan and within the agreed-upon rules of engagement. Keep communication channels open and active for any necessary immediate feedback or crisis management.

## Post-Engagement:
After the exercise, the red team should compile and present a detailed report of their findings. This report should include the techniques used, vulnerabilities discovered, potential impacts, and recommended remediation strategies.

## Review and Action:
The organization's leadership, security team, and other relevant stakeholders should review the red team's findings. Appropriate steps should then be taken to address identified vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture.
