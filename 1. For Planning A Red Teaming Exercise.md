# For Planning A Red Teaming Exercise SOP

## Introduction
Red Teaming refers to the testing of the security deployment’s performance to assess is preparedness, vulnerabilities and limitations. Only those tasked with executing the test, together with
the senior management levels of the security operation are aware of the test plans, dates, times and those performing the test and therefore it provides maximum impact and sometimes dramatic findings.

## Purpose
- To gain the adversary’s perspective of a target by changing our mindset from protector to attacker.
- To go through the thought process and appreciate the limitations of the attacker which will assist us in our threat probability analysis.
- To understand the level of professionalism needed to perform reconnaissance (information gathering) and to utilize that understanding to enhance the protection plan.
- To help identify the “soft” points in the security of any site by putting ourselves in the adversary’s shoes.

## Scope:
This SOP applies to all members of the organization who are responsible for writing and maintaining SOPs.

## Responsibilities:
All members of the organization are responsible for following this SOP when creating new SOPs.

## Criteria
- The minimum number of SO deployed depending on site.
- In any situation, be it the SO or anyone that is in danger, the use of force is permitted to bring the situation under control or to defendagainst hostile acts.
- The SO are able to carry out duty under stressful conditions, such as access control.
- Follow iimplement procedures to control and validate a person’s access to facilities based on their role or function, including visitor control, and control of access to software programs for testing and revision.

## Execution of exercise (red teamer’s approach)
- A selected person/team (red teamer) will be tasked to access control of a given site.
- By all means, the red team must put the security of the site to test by trying to get authorization or otherwise.
- If authorization is GIVEN, red team will proceed into the premises at ease.
- However, if authorization is NOT GIVEN, try finding blind spots where people or CCTV cannot have a clear visual and enter the premises from there.
- When in the premises, conduct acts of terror, violence or any other possible form that will threaten people on site.

## Safety
1.  Because a red team exercise is not known to the security operatives in the field, the threat that faces them can often appear to be very real and extreme precautions must be taken to
    prevent any reaction from the security team that could endanger their lives or those of the public or could reveal classified information. It is the responsibility of the manager of the
    exercise to plan for all eventualities and ensure the safety of the security teams and the general public.
2.  Follow and abide by all the criteria and purpose stated above to ensure a smooth and safe exercise.

## Contingency plan
In the event where authorization is given to an unexpected person, the SO shall:
1.  Alert supervisor and contact Ops room (contact no.) and call the police (999).
2.  Monitor the person closely, but do not try to stop him/her if it requires unnecessary risks to be taken.
3.  If possible, stop, detain and question the person until further assistance arrives.
4.  Update the criteria in anyway that will tighten the security making it harder to get authorization.
In the event where people enter premises through blind spots of the premises where it is not clearly visible to human or CCTV, SO shall:
1.  Upon noticing, alert supervisor, contact Ops room (contact no.) and call the police (999).
2.  Monitor the person closely, but do not try to stop him/her if it requires unnecessary risks to be taken.
3.  If possible, stop, detain and question the person until further assistance arrives.
4.  Increase patrol around that area and/or install CCTV to cover that vicinity to give a clear view.

## Measuring success
There are 2 ways of measuring the success of the exercise:
1.  Success/Fail: Did the adversary successfully carry out the simulated attack?
2.  Quantitative measure: Grades are given according to a number of criteria such as how well the security team carried out its tasks, the strengths/weaknesses of 
    the procedures followed and how well the security teams’ were trained. The grade is calculated according to a pre-established formula that results in an empiric 
    value that can be tracked over time as exercises are repeated. Therefore the trends in improvement (or worsening!) of the teams’ performance can be measured.

## Benefits
The benefits of a red team exercise are numerous, and go far beyond the basic testing of operational readiness. Security operatives will start tobecome more proactive in 
their tasks and red teaming has been shown to inspire a “predatory feeling” in the teams thereby sharpening their skills and helping maintain their situational awareness. 
The lessons learned from a red team exercise serve as a tool for continuous improvement and allow an organization to test the suitability and accuracy of Standard Operating Procedures.

## Definitions:
- Policy: Broad, overarching guidance that outlines the "why" behind specific procedures or processes.
- SOP: Detailed procedures that provide specific guidance on the "what, when, why" of a process or procedure.
- Work Instructions: In-depth, step-by-step directions that provide specific guidance on the "how" of a process or procedure.
